# marker_detection

ar_detection_ws => workspace
camera_calibration => holds the cameras calibration files (ost.yaml)

First you need to source the workspace!

In bash and with the repo in user's home directory:

```bash
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
source ~/marker_detection/ar_detection_ws/install/local_setup.bash
```
or
```bash
source ~/marker_detection/ar_detection_ws/install/setup.bash
```
The latter example also sources ROS2 and the workspace!
